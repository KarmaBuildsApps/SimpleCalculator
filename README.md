# SimpleCalculator
#This simple calculator application can deal with operations maths problem like 4+5/2 or 12*2+6/3+2-3. In order to solve simple maths problem, the algorithm needs to make sure to follow BODMAS (where BO is not yet implemented but can be easily implemented) order. For this task, the app sorts the problem entry into reverse polish notation format first and then does orderly (SimpleMaths class does the math part).
# 
#   The app has also included tests to check the operations are performing correctly and user's inputs are valid.
 #   
  #    The app follows MVP design pattern. This design pattern gives the app concern separation feature and writing tests for
   #     the app is easy and bug free with design pattern.
